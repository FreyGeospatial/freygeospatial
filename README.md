### Hi there 👋

<!--
**FreyGeospatial/freygeospatial** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a software engineer with a background in geospatial data science, and a strong advocate for event-driven, microservice architectures. I develop data-centric and production-ready applications with Python, R, and SQL for all cloud environments. I'm primarily interested in DevOps, automating data pipelines, and spatial statistics. 

⛏️ I’m working on developing extensible, testable, scalable, and fault-tolerant data pipelines ⚡️👨🏻‍💻
 
🌱 I’m currently learning [GoLang](https://go.dev/)
